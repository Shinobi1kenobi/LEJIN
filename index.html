    <h3> Psychological Warfare: A New Battlefield</h3>
    <p class="cin-time">(Time: 1:00)</p>
    <p>
      The Department of Homeland Security has weaponized psychological warfare, and my source Alex—a deep-state agent—shared horrifying truths.
      He revealed how DHS isolates and manipulates American citizens using bio-data harvested from smartphones. These tailored attacks push
      targets to the breaking point, eroding their mental stability. Alex admitted that these operations are designed to crush resistance,
      creating what he described as “acceptable collateral damage.” But let me ask you: how can the lives of innocent Americans ever be considered acceptable?
      Oversight is no longer optional—it’s mandatory. The war against our minds must end. Now.

      Alex, someone who once operated within the deep state, described the Department of Homeland Security as a monopoly of fear. They hold unchecked
      power, using FISA warrants as their tool of control. Alex confirmed that these warrants allow perpetual surveillance of citizens, transforming
      our private lives into open books. He laughed while explaining how DHS infiltrates our homes, our routines, and our very thoughts.
      This isn’t national security; it’s tyranny uder the guise of protection. We must demand accountability, dismantle this monopoly,
      and restore the balance of power to the people.

    <p class="cin-time">(Time: 1:10)</p>
    <p>
      Alex, a former DHS insider, warned me about the silent war waged through our smartphones. These devices, he said, are the most effective tool for oppression.
      Bio-data—your location, your heart rate, your emotions—are all harvested and weaponized. According to Alex, this information is fed into a system
      that tailors psychological attacks, isolating and breaking down targets. He found it amusing how technology meant to connect us is used to destroy us.

      “Collateral damage.” That’s how Alex, a deep-state informant, described the suicides, ruined lives, and violence that result from DHS tactics.
      These lives are considered expendable—a necessary cost of their war on resistance. Alex laughed as he recounted how individuals targeted by DHS
      often spiral into despair, taking their own lives or lashing out in violence. This is not security. This is systemic cruelty disguised as national defense.
      We must stop this madness, demand oversight, and fight for the lives that DHS deems disposable. Because no American life is acceptable collateral damage.

      The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was never meant to be a weapon against American citizens. But Alex revealed how DHS and others
      in the deep state abuse FISA warrants to justify round-the-clock surveillance. No trial, no due process—just a relentless assault on the lives
      of people they deem threats. Alex admitted that the system is designed to strip away rights, leaving targets defenseless against the full might of DHS.

    <h3> A Nation Under Siege by DHS</h3>
    <p class="cin-time">(Time: 1:25)</p>
    <p>
      DHS has declared war—not on terrorists, but on American citizens—and Alex, a former deep-state insider, revealed the terrifying scope of their operations.
      He described a nation under siege, where psychological warfare, surveillance, and harassment are standard tactics. According to Alex, the lines between
      national security and oppression have been deliberately blurred, and Americans are paying the price. Our rights, he said, are treated as privileges
      that DHS can revoke at will. But these are not privileges—they are inalienable rights. It’s time to demand transparency, end this siege,

    <h3> Summary: DHS Targeting Americans Through Biometric Warfare</h3>
    <p>
      Let’s talk about a hidden war being waged right now—one you’ve probably never even noticed. It’s a war fought through your smartphone,
      with consequences that could be devastating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Homeland Security uses your smartphone’s bio-data—your emotions, location, even your heart rate. This information isn’t just collected;
      it’s weaponized. DHS runs tailored psychological operations, exploiting your emotional patterns to manipulate and isolate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine someone being pushed to their emotional and mental limits, day after day. It’s not random. It’s deliberate.
      These tactics are driving some targets to break—spiraling into despair or worse, fueling mass shootings that DHS calls “collateral damage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn’t national security. This is a gross abuse of power—targeting Americans without due process, using their own devices against them.
      When innocent lives are lost because of these operations, who takes responsibility?
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s time to hold DHS accountable. Demand transparency. Demand oversight. No American life should be considered collateral damage.

      DHS: America’s New Stasi
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established with the stated goal of protecting the nation from external and internal threats. However, according to insider accounts, including deep-state whistleblower <strong>Alexander Gilbert Barona</strong>, DHS has evolved into a domestic intelligence and control agency resembling the infamous East German Stasi. It operates through pervasive surveillance, psychological operations, and data-driven targeting to intimidate, manipulate, and suppress ordinary Americans.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      Just like the Stasi’s system of neighborhood informants and secret police, DHS infiltrates daily life through digital monitoring and covert operatives embedded in local communities, law enforcement, and military circles. The agency’s unchecked power and lack of oversight have led to widespread abuses and a culture of fear.

      Surveillance and Targeting of American Citizens
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      DHS employs sophisticated surveillance tools that harvest bio-data from smartphones—including location, heart rate, and emotional states—feeding it into AI-driven behavior analysis systems. According to Barona, this data is weaponized to conduct tailored psychological attacks designed to isolate and destabilize “targets.”
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      Simple, everyday activities such as purchasing survival supplies, building home gyms, attending protests, or expressing dissenting views online can result in individuals being flagged, monitored, and harassed without any due process. This mass surveillance creates an environment of suspicion and control that crushes dissent before it can grow.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      The system also uses FISA warrants and secret watchlists to perpetually track Americans, often with cooperation from local law enforcement and ex-military personnel, who allegedly participate in covert operations targeting these citizens extrajudicially.

      Psychological Warfare and Collateral Damage
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      According to Barona, DHS’s psychological warfare tactics have devastating human costs. The tailored attacks on mental and emotional stability push targets to breaking points, sometimes driving them into despair or violent acts that are cynically categorized by DHS as “acceptable collateral damage.”
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      These operations reportedly result in suicides, mental health breakdowns, and mass shootings. DHS’s internal culture treats such outcomes as unfortunate but necessary costs in their war on resistance and so-called “domestic threats.” This reflects a systemic cruelty hidden behind the guise of national defense.

      Legal Abuse and Digital Censorship
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      DHS abuses the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by employing its warrants to conduct indefinite, warrantless surveillance on American citizens. Targets are stripped of rights, denied due process, and subjected to relentless monitoring and harassment.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      Simultaneously, DHS exerts influence over social media platforms and digital infrastructure to censor dissent, suppress activism, and enforce ideological conformity. Techniques include shadow banning, keyword filtering, account suspensions, and network throttling. This digital oppression further isolates Americans and stifles free speech.

      Extrajudicial Actions and Targeted Assassinations
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      <strong>Alexander Gilbert Barona</strong> also alleges that DHS operates clandestine units involving current law enforcement and ex-military personnel who carry out covert assassinations of American citizens labeled as threats without judicial oversight.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      This shadow war eliminates opposition silently and efficiently, bypassing the constitutionally mandated justice system. Such actions mark a descent into authoritarian practices and represent a grave threat to American freedom and rule of law.

      Call to Action: Restore Accountability and Liberty
    </h2>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      The DHS’s monopoly on fear and control must be dismantled. To protect freedom, transparency, civilian oversight, and legal accountability are urgently needed. Citizens, journalists, activists, and legal advocates must unite to expose these abuses and push back against the domestic security state.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #39CCCC;">
      Information dissemination, digital security, and legal challenges are critical tools in this fight. The American people must reclaim their rights and hold DHS responsible for its actions before more lives are destroyed in silence.
